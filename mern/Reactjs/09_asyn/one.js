//async code

//javascript is single threaded
//synchronous code
//slow as compared to asynchronous code
//execution context
//execute one line of code at a time
//console log 1 followed by console log 2
//call stack  memory heap

//blocking code vs non-blocking code
//blocking code: code that blocks the execution of other code  : read file synchronously  it will wait for the file to be read before executing the next line of code
//non-blocking code: code that does not block the execution of other code : read file asynchronously it will not wait for the file to be read before executing the next line of code

//database : file
//JS engine   ::-> web api -> callback queue -> event loop -> call stack

//set timeout :0 it will be little slower than the synchronous code
